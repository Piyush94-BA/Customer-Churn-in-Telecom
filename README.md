# Predicting Customer Churn in Telecom Companies

Churn of customers signifies the departure of customers from a company’s service or subscription after a certain time. Churn is an important consideration in the telecommunication services industry. With the telecommunication services market being a highly competitive one, it becomes critical for companies to analyze that why customers are leaving their services to subscribe to others.

Churn rates can be used to analyze a company’s marketing and pricing strategies, the quality of its customer service policies and its overall growth prospects. The purpose of all such analysis is the same, to reduce losses by retaining profitable customers.

In this project, we use classification algorithms to predict the customers that are likely to churn from a telecommunication company’s services. We use the SMOTE algorithm to deal with the class imbalance in the dataset.
